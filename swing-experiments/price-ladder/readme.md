# Price Ladder

Here, I'm experimenting with a custom virtual list model that generates elements on the fly,
and a custom list cell renderer that can display a price ladder and background colors.
I also made sure I understood how to detect left and right clicks on the ladder without
adding a listener to every list element.

All of these capabilities, put together, will allow me to make a Java swing version of
my [TradeRisk](https://github.com/rwtodd/TradeRisk) tool.
