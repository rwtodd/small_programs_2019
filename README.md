# small programs 2019

These are small programs that don't deserve their own repo. I make
a repo for these every year now, so I don't lose track of them.

- __calibron-12__: A backtracking solver for the Calibron-12 brain teaser.
- __ge-walks__: A lisp program to count random walks that never drop below a given level
- __postcard-pathtrace__: A small pathtracer benchmark / toy program
- __script-vba__: Some Word VisualBasic code to help me automate formatting scripts
- __surreal__: Some common-lisp code for playing with surreal numbers
- __UlamSpiral__: A win32 program to display variations on the ulam spiral.
